## Introduction

This document demonstrates the use of the `sklearn` library in Python to do modeling via *multiple linear regression*.

::: callout-note
If you do not have the `sklearn` library installed then you will need to run

`pip install sklearn`

in the Jupyter/Colab terminal to install. **Remember:** you only need to install once per machine (or Colab session).

```{python}
#| label: libraries-py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
```

## Machine Learning Mission

Recall that in machine learning our goal is to **predict** the value of some *target* variable using one or more *predictor* variables. Mathematically, we we're in the following setup

\[
y = f(X) + \epsilon
\]

where $y$ is our target variable and $X$ represents the collection of our predictor variables.
