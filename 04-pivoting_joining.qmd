## Introduction

This document demonstrates the use of the `pandas` library in Python to do basic data wrangling and summarization.

::: callout-note
If you do not have the `pandas` library installed then you will need to run

`pip install pandas`

in the Jupyter terminal to install. **Remember:** you only need to install once per machine (or Colab session).
