## Introduction

This document demonstrates the use of the `beautifulsoup` library in Python to do webscraping.

::: callout-note
If you do not have the `pandas` library installed then you will need to run

`pip install pandas`

in the Jupyter terminal to install. **Remember:** you only need to install once per machine (or Colab session).
:::

```{python}
import pandas as pd
```

```{python}
#|eval: false

# Population data from GapMinder
population = pd.read_csv("/content/pop.csv")
```
