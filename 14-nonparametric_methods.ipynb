        "\n",
        "For these reasons, decision trees are a very popular choice for fitting in bulk (i.e. Random Forest). If we grow them to be large and fit the data very well, but do this many times then we're able to \"adjust\" for the overfitting. Random forests are beyond the scope of this class, but can be pursued in future project and coursework.\n",
