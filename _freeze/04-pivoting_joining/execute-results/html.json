Rare is the day when we can open a dataset for the first time and it's ready for every type of visualization or analysis that we could want to do with it.\n\nIn addition to the wrangling we discussed in the previous chapter, there may be a need to reshape the dataset entirely. For example, the column names might be values themselves that we want to make use of.\n\nRecall our introduction of *tidy* data in the previous chapter...\n\n### Tidy Data is Special Tabular Data\n\nFor most people, the image that comes to mind when thinking about data is indeed something tabular or spreadsheet-like in nature. **Which is great!**\n\nTabular data is a form preferred by MANY different data operations and work. However, we will want to take this one step further. In almost all data science work we want our data to be **tidy**\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\nA dataset is **tidy** if it adheres to following three characteristics:\n\n* Every column is a variable\n\n* Every row is an observation\n\n* Every cell is a single value\n\n:::\n\n![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6f1ddb544fc5c69a2478e444ab8112fb0eea23f8/91adc/images/tidy-1.png)\n\nIn the previous chapter you were asked to open up a GapMinder dataset [here](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) and to comment on whether this dataset was *tidy* or not. \nThe answer was **no**, this dataset is not *tidy*. These datasets come with a row representing a country, each column representing a year, and each cell representing the value of the global indicator selected. To be *tidy* these three variables (`country`, `year`, `global indicator`) should each have their own column, instead of the `year` variable taking values as the column headers.\n\n### Wide to Long Format\n\nThe GapMinder dataset is an example of what's commonly referred to as data in a *wide format*. To make this dataset *tidy* we aim for a dataset with columns for `country`, `year`, and `global indicator` (e.g. population). Three columns is many fewer than the current number of columns, and so we will convert this dataset from *wide to long format*.\n\n:::{.callout-warning}\n\nIt often helps to physically draw/map out what our current dataset looks like and what the look of our target dataset is, before actually trying to write any code to do this. Writing the code can be **extremely** easier after this exercise, and only makes future pivot operations easier.\n\n:::\n\nIn order to convert our dataset from *wide to long format* we will use `.melt()` (or `.wide_to_long()`) in `pandas`. \n\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nlong_population = population.melt(id_vars=[\"country\"], var_name=\"year\", value_name=\"population\")\n```\n\n\n:::{.callout-check-in .icon}\n\nWith 2-3 people around you navigate to GapMinder, download the population dataset, and convert it from wide to long format. Does the result look how you expect? Is any other wrangling necessary?\n\n:::\n\n### Long to Wide Format\n\nEven though certain data shapes are not considered *tidy*, they may be more conducive to performing certain operations than other shapes. For example, what if we were interested in the change in country population between 1950 and 2010? In the original *wide* shape of the GapMinder data this operation would have been a simple difference of columns like below.\n\n``` {.python .cell-code}\npopulation[\"pop_diff\"] = population[\"2010\"] - population[\"1950\"]\n```\n\n\n:::{.callout-check-in .icon}\n\nWhy doesn't the above code work without further wrangling? What in the dataset needs to change for this operation to work?\n\n:::\n\nIn the *long* format of our Gapminder dataset (`long_population`), this operation is less straightforward. Sometimes datasets come to us in *long* format and to do things like the operation above we need to convert that dataset from *long to wide format*. We can go the reverse direction (i.e. *long to wide format*) with `.pivot()` in `pandas`.\n\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nwide_population = long_population.pivot(index = \"country\", columns = \"year\", values = \"population\")\nwide_population = wide_population.reset_index()\n```\n\n\n:::{.callout-learn-more .icon collapse=\"true\"}\n\nWe haven't spent much time discussing the `index` of a `pandas` DataFrame, but you can think of it like an address for data, or slices of data in a DataFrame. You can also think of an `index` (or `indices`) as row names, or axis labels, for your dataset. This can be useful for a number of functions in Python, and can enhance the look of results or visualizations.\n\nHowever, understanding them is not critical for what we will do in Python. Furthermore, variables that are `indices` for a DataFrame cannot be accessed or referenced in the same way as other variables in the DataFrame. So, we will avoid their use if possible.\n\n:::\n\n## Joining Datasets in Python\n\nThe information you need is often spread across multiple data sets, so you will need to combine multiple data sets into one. In this chapter, we discuss strategies for combining information from multiple (tabular) data sets.\n\nAs a working example, we will use a data set of baby names collected by the Social Security Administration. Each data set in this collection contains the names of all babies born in the United States in a particular year. This data is publicly available, and a copy has been made available at [https://dlsun.github.io/pods/data/names/](https://dlsun.github.io/pods/data/names/).\n\n### Concatenating and Merging Data\n\n#### Concatenation\n\nSometimes, the *rows* of data are spread across multiple files, and we want to combine the rows into a single data set. The process of combining rows from different data sets is known as concatenation.\n\nVisually, to concatenate two `DataFrames`, we simply stack them on top of one another.\n\nFor example, suppose we want to understand how the popularity of different names evolved between 1995 and 2015. The 1995 names and the 2015 names are stored in two different files: `yob1995.txt` and `yob2015.txt`, respectively. To carry out this analysis, we will need to combine these two data sets into one.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndata_dir = \"http://dlsun.github.io/pods/data/names/\"\nnames1995 = pd.read_csv(data_dir + \"yob1995.txt\",\n                        header=None,\n                        names=[\"Name\", \"Sex\",

There is no longer any way to distinguish the 1995 data from the 2015 data. To fix this, we can add a **Year** column to each `DataFrame` before we concatenate.\n\n2. The indexes from the original `DataFrames` are preserved in the concatenated `DataFrame`. (To see this, observe that the last index in the `DataFrame` is about 33000, which corresponds to the number of rows in `names2015`, even though there are 59000 rows in the `DataFrame`.) That means that there are two rows with an index of 0, two rows with an index of 1, and so on. To force `pandas` to generate a completely new index for this `DataFrame`, ignoring the indices from the original `DataFrames`, we specify `ignore_index=True`.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nnames1995[\"Year\"] = 1995\nnames2015[\"Year\"] = 2015\nnames = pd.concat([names1995, names2015], ignore_index=True)\nnames\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=5}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Name</th>\n      <th>Sex</th>\n      <th>Count</th>\n      <th>Year</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Jessica</td>\n      <td>F</td>\n      <td>27935</td>\n      <td>1995</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>Ashley</td>\n      <td>F</td>\n      <td>26603</td>\n      <td>1995</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>Emily</td>\n      <td>F</td>\n      <td>24378</td>\n      <td>1995</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>Samantha</td>\n      <td>F</td>\n      <td>21646</td>\n      <td>1995</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>Sarah</td>\n      <td>F</td>\n      <td>21369</td>\n      <td>1995</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>59196</th>\n      <td>Zykell</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>2015</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>59197</th>\n      <td>Zyking</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>2015</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>59198</th>\n      <td>Zykir</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>2015</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>59199</th>\n      <td>Zyrus</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>2015</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>59200</th>\n      <td>Zyus</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>2015</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>59201 rows × 4 columns</p>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow this is a `DataFrame` we can use!\n\n#### Merging (a.k.a Joining)\n\nMore commonly, the data sets that we want to combine actually contain different information about the same observations. In other words, instead of stacking the `DataFrames` on top of each other, as in concatenation, we want to stack them next to each other. The process of combining columns or variables from different data sets is known as *merging* or *joining*.\n\nThe observations may be in a different order in the two data sets, so merging is not as simple as placing the two `DataFrames` side-by-side.\n\n*Merging* is an operation on two `DataFrames` that returns a third `DataFrame`. By convention, the first `DataFrame` is referred to as the one on the \"left\", while the second `DataFrame` is the one on the \"right\".\n\nThis naming convention is reflected in the syntax of the `.merge()` function in `pandas`. In the code below, the \"left\" `DataFrame`, `names1995`, is quite literally on the left in the code, while the \"right\" `DataFrame`, `names2015`, is to the right. We also specify the variables to match across the two `DataFrames`.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nnames1995.merge(names2015, on=[\"Name\", \"Sex\"])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=6}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Name</th>\n      <th>Sex</th>\n      <th>Count_x</th>\n      <th>Year_x</th>\n      <th>Count_y</th>\n      <th>Year_y</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Jessica</td>\n      <td>F</td>\n      <td>27935</td>\n      <td>1995</td>\n      <td>1587</td>\n      <td>2015</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>Ashley</td>\n      <td>F</td>\n      <td>26603</td>\n      <td>1995</td>\n      <td>3424</td>\n      <td>2015</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>Emily</td>\n      <td>F</td>\n      <td>24378</td>\n      <td>1995</td>\n      <td>11786</td>\n      <td>2015</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>Samantha</td>\n      <td>F</td>\n      <td>21646</td>\n      <td>1995</td>\n      <td>5340</td>\n      <td>2015</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>Sarah</td>\n      <td>F</td>\n      <td>21369</td>\n      <td>1995</td>\n      <td>4521</td>\n      <td>2015</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>15675</th>\n      <td>Zephan</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>1995</td>\n      <td>23</td>\n      <td>2015</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>15676</th>\n      <td>Zeppelin</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>1995</td>\n      <td>70</td>\n      <td>2015</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>15677</th>\n      <td>Zerek</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>1995</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>2015</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>15678</th>\n      <td>Ziggy</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>1995</td>\n      <td>44</td>\n      <td>2015</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>15679</th>\n      <td>Zyon</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>1995</td>\n      <td>148</td>\n      <td>2015</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>15680 rows × 6 columns</p>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe **most important component** of *merging* two datasets is the presence of at least one *key* variable that both datasets share. This variable is sometimes referred to as an *ID variable*. It's this variable that we will want to *merge on*, i.e. use to combine the two datasets intelligently.\n\nThe variables that we joined on (`Name` and `Sex`) appear once in the final `DataFrame`. The variable `Count`, which we did not join on, appears twice---since there was a column called `Count` in both of the original `DataFrames`. Notice that `pandas` automatically appended the suffix `_x` to the name of the variable from the left `DataFrame` and `_y` to the one from the right `DataFrame`.

These two data sets are thus said to have a one-to-one relationship. The same would be true of combining two GapMinder datasets.\n\nHowever, two data sets need not have a one-to-one relationship! Two datasets could have a *many-to-one relationship*. In general, it's **extremely important** to think carefully about what variables each of your two datasets have to begin with, and what variables you want your merged dataset to have...and what that merged dataset will represent with respect to your data.\n\n#### Many-to-Many Relationships: A Cautionary Tale\n\nIt is also possible for multiple rows in the left `DataFrame` to match multiple rows in the right `DataFrame`. In this case, the two data sets are said to have a *many-to-many relationship*. Many-to-many joins can lead to misleading analyses, so it is important to exercise caution when working with many-to-many relationships.\n\nFor example, in the baby names data set, the `Name` variable is not uniquely identifying.

But what happens when a row in one `DataFrame` has no match in the other?\n\nFirst, let's investigate how `pandas` handles this situation by default.

Let's look at how common this name was five years earlier and five years after.\n\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndata_dir = \"http://dlsun.github.io/pods/data/names/\"\n\nnames1995 = pd.read_csv(data_dir + \"yob1995.txt\",\n                        header=None, names=[\"Name\", \"Sex\", \"Count\"])\nnames2005 = pd.read_csv(data_dir + \"yob2005.txt\",\n                        header=None, names=[\"Name\", \"Sex\", \"Count\"])\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=17}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nnames1995[names1995.Name == \"Nevaeh\"]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=13}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Name</th>\n      <th>Sex</th>\n      <th>Count</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=18}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nnames2005[names2005.Name == \"Nevaeh\"]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=14}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Name</th>\n      <th>Sex</th>\n      <th>Count</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>68</th>\n      <td>Nevaeh</td>\n      <td>F</td>\n      <td>4552</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>21353</th>\n      <td>Nevaeh</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n      <td>56</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn 1995, there were no girls (at least fewer than 5) named Nevaeh; just eight years later, there were over 4500 girls (and even 56 boys) with the name. It seems like Sonny Sandoval had a huge effect.\n\nWhat happens to the name \"Nevaeh\" when we merge the two data sets?\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=19}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nnames = names1995.merge(names2005, on=[\"Name\", \"Sex\"])\nnames[names.Name == \"Nevaeh\"]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=15}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Name</th>\n      <th>Sex</th>\n      <th>Count_x</th>\n      <th>Count_y</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBy default, `pandas` only includes combinations that are present in both `DataFrames`. If it cannot find a match for a row in one `DataFrame`, then the combination is simply dropped.\n\nBut in this context, the fact that a name does not appear in one data set is informative. It means that no babies were born in that year with that name. We might want to include names that appeared in only one of the two `DataFrames`, rather than just the names that appeared in both.\n\nThere are four types of joins, distinguished by whether they include the rows from the left `DataFrame`, the right `DataFrame`, both, or neither:\n\n1. *inner join* (default): only values that are present in both `DataFrames` are included in the result\n2. *outer join*: any value that appears in either `DataFrame` is included in the result\n3. *left join*: any value that appears in the left `DataFrame` is included in the result, whether or not it appears in the right `DataFrame`\n4. *right join*: any value that appears in the right `DataFrame` is included in the result, whether or not it appears in the left `DataFrame`.\n\nOne way to visualize the different types of joins is using Venn diagrams. The shaded region indicates which rows that are included in the output. For example, only rows that appear in both the left and right `DataFrames` are included in the output of an inner join.\n\n![](https://github.com/dlsun/pods/blob/master/09-Joining-Tabular-Data/joins.png?raw=1)\n\nIn `pandas`, the join type is specified using the `how=` argument.\n\nNow let's look at the examples of each of these types of joins.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=20}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# inner join\nnames_inner = names1995.merge(names2005, on=[\"Name\", \"Sex\"], how=\"inner\")\nnames_inner\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=16}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Name</th>\n      <th>Sex</th>\n      <th>Count_x</th>\n      <th>Count_y</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Jessica</td>\n      <td>F</td>\n      <td>27935</td>\n      <td>8108</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>Ashley</td>\n      <td>F</td>\n      <td>26603</td>\n      <td>13270</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>Emily</td>\n      <td>F</td>\n      <td>24378</td>\n      <td>23930</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>Samantha</td>\n      <td>F</td>\n      <td>21646</td>\n      <td>13633</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>Sarah</td>\n      <td>F</td>\n      <td>21369</td>\n      <td>11527</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>19119</th>\n      <td>Zeppelin</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>7</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>19120</th>\n      <td>Zerek</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>19121</th>\n      <td>Zhen</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>7</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>19122</th>\n      <td>Ziggy</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>19123</th>\n      <td>Zyon</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>102</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>19124 rows × 4 columns</p>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=21}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# outer join\nnames_outer = names1995.merge(names2005, on=[\"Name\", \"Sex\"], how=\"outer\")\nnames_outer\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=17}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Name</th>\n      <th>Sex</th>\n      <th>Count_x</th>\n      <th>Count_y</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Jessica</td>\n      <td>F</td>\n      <td>27935.0</td>\n      <td>8108.0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>Ashley</td>\n      <td>F</td>\n      <td>26603.0</td>\n      <td>13270.0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>Emily</td>\n      <td>F</td>\n      <td>24378.0</td>\n      <td>23930.0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>Samantha</td>\n      <td>F</td>\n      <td>21646.0</td>\n      <td>13633.0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>Sarah</td>\n      <td>F</td>\n      <td>21369.0</td>\n      <td>11527.0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>39490</th>\n      <td>Zymiere</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>5.0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>39491</th>\n      <td>Zyrell</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>5.0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>39492</th>\n      <td>Zyrian</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>5.0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>39493</th>\n      <td>Zyshon</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>5.0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>39494</th>\n      <td>Zytavious</td>\n      <td>M</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>5.0</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>39495 rows × 4 columns</p>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNames like \"Zyrell\" and \"Zyron\" appeared in the 2005 data but not the 1995 data.
